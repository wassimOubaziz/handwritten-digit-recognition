# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Overview

This project is a web-based application that recognizes handwritten digits using a neural network built with JavaScript. It provides a simple and interactive way to test the model's accuracy in identifying numbers drawn on a canvas.

## Features

- **Interactive Canvas**: Users can draw digits on a responsive canvas.
- **Neural Network**: Utilizes a model trained with PyTorch for speedy predictions.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes with a mobile-friendly interface.
- **Dark/Light Mode Support**: Easily switch between dark and light themes.
- **Attribution**: Developed by Wassim Oubaziz.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For the main functionality and predictions.
- **HTML & CSS**: For structuring and styling the application.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For a modern and responsive design.
- **Next.js**: Framework for building the React application.
